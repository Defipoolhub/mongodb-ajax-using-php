# MongoDB AJAX Pagination with Search and Sort using PHP
A simple project demonstrating how you can paginate your MongoDB documents which includes search, filter and sort features.

I was recently working on a project that makes use of MongoDB as their database, the client wanted to have a Paginated list of documents, Search box, Column Sorting feature and a Per Page Filter. There are over 5 million documents in their database which are basically generated tickets for their customers. Since I have an existing pagination which actually works like a charm, I thought i’d try to convert it to make use mongoDB’s query methods. I was successful in developing my client’s requests and now I just wanted to share to you guys how I did it.

I can’t provide a demo link at the moment as I am only running my site in a shared hosting, but I do hope that you find this tutorial useful.
